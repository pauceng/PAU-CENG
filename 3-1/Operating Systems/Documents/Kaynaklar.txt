UNIX System Calls



                                UNIX System Calls


     A system call is just what its name implies -- a request for the
     operating system to do something on behalf of the user's program.  The
     system calls are functions used in the kernel itself.  To the
     programmer, the system call appears as a normal C function call.
     However since a system call executes code in the kernel, there must be a
     mechanism to change the mode of a process from user mode to kernel mode.
     The C compiler uses a predefined library of functions (the C library)
     that have the names of the system calls.  The library functions
     typically invoke an instruction that changes the process execution mode
     to kernel mode and causes the kernel to start executing code for system
     calls.  The instruction that causes the mode change is often referred to
     as an "operating system trap" which is a software generated interrupt.
     The library routines execute in user mode, but the system call interface
     is a special case of an interrupt handler.  The library functions pass
     the kernel a unique number per system call in a machine dependent way --
     either as a parameter to the operating system trap, in a particular
     register, or on the stack -- and the kernel thus determines the specific
     system call the user is invoking.  In handling the operating system
     trap, the kernel looks up the system call number in a table to find the
     address of the appropriate kernel routine that is the entry point for
     the system call and to find the number of parameters the system call
     expects.  The kernel calculates the (user) address of the first
     parameter to the system call by adding (or subtracting, depending on the
     direction of stack growth) an offset to the user stack pointer,
     corresponding to the number of the parameters to the system call.
     Finally, it copies the user parameters to the "u area" and call the
     appropriate system call routine.  After executing the code for the
     system call, the kernel determines whether there was an error.  If so,
     it adjusts register locations in the saved user register context,
     typically setting the "carry" bit for the PS (processor status) register
     and copying the error number into register 0 location.  If there were no
     errors in the execution of the system call, the kernel clears the
     "carry" bit in the PS register and copies the appropriate return values
     from the system call into the locations for registers 0 and 1 in the
     saved user register context.  When the kernel returns from the operating
     system trap to user mode, it returns to the library instruction after
     the trap instruction.  The library interprets the return values from the
     kernel and returns a value to the user program.

     UNIX system calls are used to manage the file system, control processes,
     and to provide interprocess communication.  The UNIX system interface
     consists of about 80 system calls (as UNIX evolves this number will
     increase).  The following table lists about 40 of the more important
     system call:

     [NOTE:  The system call interface is that aspect of UNIX that has
     changed the most since the inception of the UNIX system.  Therefore,
     when you write a software tool, you should protect that tool by putting
     system calls in other subroutines within your program and then calling
     only those subroutines.  Should the next version of the UNIX system
     change the syntax and semantics of the system calls you've used, you
     need only change your interface routines.]


                                        -2-









     When a system call discovers and error, it returns -1 and stores the
     reason the called failed in an external variable named "errno".  The 
     "/usr/include/errno.h" file maps these error numbers to manifest
     constants, and it these constants that you should use in your programs.

     When a system call returns successfully, it returns something other than
     -1, but it does not clear "errno".  "errno" only has meaning directly
     after a system call that returns an error.

     When you use system calls in your programs, you should check the value
     returned by those system calls.  Furthermore, when a system call
     discovers an error, you should use the "perror()" subroutine to print a
     diagnostic message on the standard error file that describes why the
     system call failed.   The syntax for "perror()" is:

     void perror(string)
     char string;

     "perror()" displays the argument string, a colon, and then the error
     message, as directed by "errno", followed by a newline.  The output of
     "perror()" is displayed on "standard error".  Typically, the argument
     give to "perror()" is the name of the program that incurred the error,
     argv[0].  However, when using subroutines and system calls on files, the
     related file name might be passed to "perror()".

     There are occasions where you the programmer might wish to maintain more
     control over the printing of error messages than "perror()" provides --
     such as with a formatted screen where the newline printed by "perror()"
     would destroy the formatting.  In this case, you can directly access the
     same system external (global) variables that "perror()" uses.  They are:

     extern int errno;
     extern char *sys_errlist[];
     extern int sys_nerr;

     "errno" has been described above.  "sys_errlist" is an array (table) of
     pointers to the error message strings.  Each message string is null
     terminated and does not contain a newline.  "sys_nerr" is the number of
     messages in the error message table and is the maximum value "errno" can
     assume.  "errno" is used as the index into the table of error messages.
     Following are two sample programs that display all of the system error
     messages on standard error.

     Following are some examples in the use of the most often used system
     calls.

                       File Structure Related System Calls

     The file structure related system calls available in the UNIX system let
     you create, open, and close files, read and write files, randomly access
     files, alias and remove files, get information about files, check the
     accessibility of files, change protections, owner, and group of files,
     and control devices.  These operations either use a character string
     that defines the absolute or relative path name of a file, or a small
     integer called a file descriptor that identifies the I/O channel.  A
     channel is a connection between a process and a file that appears to the
     process as an unformatted stream of bytes.  The kernel presents and
     accepts data from the channel as a process reads and writes that
     channel.  To a process then, all input and output operations are
     synchronous and unbuffered.

     When doing I/O, a process specifies the file descriptor for an I/O
     channel, a buffer to be filled or emptied, and the maximum size of data
     to be transferred.  An I/O channel may allow input, output, or both.
     Furthermore, each channel has a read/write pointer.  Each I/O operation
     starts where the last operation finished and advances the pointer by the
     number of bytes transferred.  A process can access a channel's data
     randomly by changing the read/write pointer.

     All input and output operations start by opening a file using either the
     "creat()" or "open()" system calls.  These calls return a file
     descriptor that identifies the I/O channel.  Recall that file
     descriptors 0, 1, and 2 refer to standard input, standard output, and
     standard error files respectively, and that file descriptor 0 is a
     channel to your terminal's keyboard and file descriptors 1 and 2 are
     channels to your terminal's display screen.

                                     creat()

     The prototype for the creat() system call is:

     int creat(file_name, mode)
     char *file_name;
     int mode;

     where file_name is pointer to a null terminated character string that
     names the file and mode defines the file's access permissions.  The mode
     is usually specified as an octal number such as 0666 that would mean
     read/write permission for owner, group, and others or the mode may also
     be entered using manifest constants defined in the
     "/usr/include/sys/stat.h" file.  If the file named by file_name does not
     exist, the UNIX system creates it with the specified mode permissions.
     However, if the file does exist, its contents are discarded and the mode
     value is ignored.  The permissions of the existing file are retained.
     Following is an example of how to use creat():


                                        -5-












     /*  creat.c */

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <sys/types.h>        /* defines types used by sys/stat.h */
     #include <sys/stat.h>         /* defines S_IREAD & S_IWRITE       */

     int main()
     {
        int fd;
        fd = creat("datafile.dat", S_IREAD | S_IWRITE);
        if (fd == -1)
           printf("Error in opening datafile.dat\n");
        else
           {
           printf("datafile.dat opened for read/write access\n");
           printf("datafile.dat is currently empty\n");
           }
        close(fd);
        exit (0);
     }

     The following is a sample of the manifest constants for the mode
     argument as defined in /usr/include/sys/stat.h:

     #define S_IRWXU 0000700     /* -rwx------ */
     #define S_IREAD 0000400     /* read permission, owner */
     #define S_IRUSR S_IREAD
     #define S_IWRITE 0000200    /* write permission, owner */
     #define S_IWUSR S_IWRITE
     #define S_IEXEC 0000100     /* execute/search permission, owner */
     #define S_IXUSR S_IEXEC
     #define S_IRWXG 0000070     /* ----rwx--- */
     #define S_IRGRP 0000040     /* read permission, group */
     #define S_IWGRP 0000020     /* write    "         "   */
     #define S_IXGRP 0000010     /* execute/search "   "   */
     #define S_IRWXO 0000007     /* -------rwx */
     #define S_IROTH 0000004     /* read permission, other */
     #define S_IWOTH 0000002     /* write    "         "   */
     #define S_IXOTH 0000001     /* execute/search "   "   */

     Multiple mode values may be combined by or'ing (using the | operator)
     the values together as demonstrated in the above sample program.









                                        -6-














                                      open()

     Next is the open() system call.  open() lets you open a file for
     reading, writing, or reading and writing.

     The prototype for the open() system call is:

     #include <fcntl.h>

     int open(file_name, option_flags [, mode])
     char *file_name;
     int option_flags, mode;

     where file_name is a pointer to the character string that names the
     file, option_flags represent the type of channel, and mode defines the
     file's access permissions if the file is being created.

     The allowable option_flags as defined in "/usr/include/fcntl.h" are:

     #define  O_RDONLY 0        /* Open the file for reading only */
     #define  O_WRONLY 1        /* Open the file for writing only */
     #define  O_RDWR   2     /* Open the file for both reading and writing*/
     #define  O_NDELAY 04       /* Non-blocking I/O */
     #define  O_APPEND 010      /* append (writes guaranteed at the end) */
     #define  O_CREAT 00400  /*open with file create (uses third open arg) */
     #define  O_TRUNC  01000    /* open with truncation */
     #define  O_EXCL   02000    /* exclusive open */

     Multiple values are combined using the | operator (i.e. bitwise OR).
     Note:  some combinations are mutually exclusive such as:  O_RDONLY |
     O_WRONLY and will cause open() to fail.  If the O_CREAT flag is used,
     then a mode argument is required.  The mode argument may be specified in
     the same manner as in the creat() system call.


















                                        -7-














     Following is an example of how to use open():

     /*  open.c */

     #include <fcntl.h>         /* defines options flags */
     #include <sys/types.h>     /* defines types used by sys/stat.h */
     #include <sys/stat.h>      /* defines S_IREAD & S_IWRITE  */

     static char message[] = "Hello, world";

     int main()
     {
        int fd;
        char buffer[80];

        /* open datafile.dat for read/write access   (O_RDWR)
           create datafile.dat if it does not exist  (O_CREAT)
           return error if datafile already exists   (O_EXCL)
           permit read/write access to file  (S_IWRITE | S_IREAD)
        */
     fd = open("datafile.dat",O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_EXCL, S_IREAD | S_IWRITE);
        if (fd != -1)
           {
           printf("datafile.dat opened for read/write access\n");
           write(fd, message, sizeof(message));
           lseek(fd, 0L, 0);     /* go back to the beginning of the file */
           if (read(fd, buffer, sizeof(message)) == sizeof(message))
              printf("\"%s\" was written to datafile.dat\n", buffer);
           else
              printf("*** error reading datafile.dat ***\n");
           close (fd);
           }
        else
           printf("*** datafile.dat already exists ***\n");
        exit (0);
     }

                                     close()

     To close a channel, use the close() system call.  The prototype for the
     close() system call is:

     int close(file_descriptor)
     int file_descriptor;

     where file_descriptor identifies a currently open channel.  close()
     fails if file_descriptor does not identify a currently open channel.


                                read()     write()

     The read() system call does all input and the write() system call does
     all output.  When used together, they provide all the tools necessary to
     do input and output sequentially.  When used with the lseek() system
     call, they provide all the tools necessary to do input and output
     randomly.

     Both read() and write() take three arguments.  Their prototypes are:

     int read(file_descriptor, buffer_pointer, transfer_size)
     int file_descriptor;
     char *buffer_pointer;
     unsigned transfer_size;

     int write(file_descriptor, buffer_pointer, transfer_size)
     int file_descriptor;
     char *buffer_pointer;
     unsigned transfer_size;

     where file_descriptor identifies the I/O channel, buffer_pointer points
     to the area in memory where the data is stored  for a read() or where
     the data is taken for a write(), and transfer_size defines the maximum
     number of characters transferred between the file and the buffer.
     read() and write() return the number of bytes transferred.

     There is no limit on transfer_size, but you must make sure it's safe to
     copy transfer_size bytes to or from the memory pointed to by
     buffer_pointer.  A transfer_size of 1 is used to transfer a byte at a
     time for so-called "unbuffered" input/output.  The most efficient value
     for transfer_size is the size of the largest physical record the I/O
     channel is likely to have to handle.  Therefore, 1K bytes -- the disk
     block size -- is the most efficient general-purpose buffer size for a
     standard file.  However, if you are writing to a terminal, the transfer
     is best handled in lines ending with a newline.

     For an example using read() and write(), see the above example of
     open().

                                     lseek()

     The UNIX system file system treats an ordinary file as a sequence of
     bytes.  No internal structure is imposed on a file by the operating
     system.  Generally, a file is read or written sequentially -- that is,
     from beginning to the end of the file.  Sometimes sequential reading and
     writing is not appropriate.  It may be inefficient, for instance, to
     read an entire file just to move to the end of the file to add
     characters.  Fortunately, the UNIX system lets you read and write
     anywhere in the file.  Known as "random access", this capability is made
     possible with the lseek() system call.  During file I/O, the UNIX system
     uses a long integer, also called a File Pointer, to keep track of the
     next byte to read or write.  This long integer represents the number of
     bytes from the beginning of the file to that next character.  Random
     access I/O is achieved by changing the value of this file pointer using
     the lseek() system call.

     The prototype for lseek() is:

     long lseek(file_descriptor, offset, whence)
     int file_descriptor;
     long offset;
     int whence;

     where file_descriptor identifies the I/O channel and offset and whence
     work together to describe how to change the file pointer according to
     the following table:

           whence            new position
           ------------------------------
            0                offset bytes into the file
            1                current position in the file plus offset
            2                current end-of-file position plus offset

     If successful, lseek() returns a long integer that defines the new file
     pointer value measured in bytes from the beginning of the file.  If
     unsuccessful, the file position does not change.

     Certain devices are incapable of seeking, namely terminals and the
     character interface to a tape drive.  lseek() does not change the file
     pointer to these devices.

     Following is an example using lseek():

     /* lseek.c  */

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <fcntl.h>

     int main()
     {
        int fd;
        long position;

        fd = open("datafile.dat", O_RDONLY);
        if ( fd != -1)
           {
           position = lseek(fd, 0L, 2);  /* seek 0 bytes from end-of-file */
           if (position != -1)
              printf("The length of datafile.dat is %ld bytes.\n", position);
           else
              perror("lseek error");
           }
        else
           printf("can't open datafile.dat\n");
        close(fd);
     }


























                                       -11-














     Many UNIX systems have defined manifest constants for use as the
     "whence" argument of lseek().  The definitions can be found in the
     "file.h" and/or "unistd.h" include files.  For example, the University
     of Maryland's HP-9000 UNIX system has the following definitions:

     from file.h we have:

     #define L_SET           0       /* absolute offset */
     #define L_INCR          1       /* relative to current offset */
     #define L_XTND          2       /* relative to end of file */

     and from unistd.h we have:

     #define SEEK_SET      0      /* Set file pointer to "offset" */
     #define SEEK_CUR      1 /* Set file pointer to current plus "offset" */
     #define SEEK_END      2     /* Set file pointer to EOF plus "offset" */

     The definitions from unistd.h are the most "portable" across UNIX and
     MS-DOS C compilers.


                                      dup()

     The dup() system call duplicates an open file descriptor and returns the
     new file descriptor.  The new file descriptor has the following
     properties in common with the original file descriptor:

        refers to the same open file or pipe.

        has the same file pointer -- that is, both file descriptors share one
        file pointer.

        has the same access mode, whether read, write, or read and write.

     The prototype for dup() is:

     int dup(file_descriptor)
     int file_descriptor;

     where file_descriptor is the file descriptor describing the original I/O
     channel returned by creat(), open(), pipe(), or dup() system calls.
     dup() is guaranteed to return a file descriptor with the lowest integer
     value available.  It is because of this feature of returning the lowest
     unused file descriptor available that processes accomplish I/O
     redirection.  The following example shows standard output redirected to
     a file through the use of the dup() system call:

     {
        int fd;

        fd = open("foo.bar",O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, S_IREAD | S_IWRITE );
        if (fd == -1)
           {
           perror("foo.bar");
           exit (1);
           }
        close(1);         /* close standard output  */
        dup(fd);       /* fd will be duplicated into standard out's slot */
        close(fd);        /* close the extra slot */
        printf("Hello, world!\n");    /* should go to file foo.bar */
        exit (0);         /* exit() will close the files */

                                      link()

     The UNIX system file structure allows more than one named reference to a
     given file, a feature called "aliasing".  Making an alias to a file
     means that the file has more than one name, but all names of the file
     refer to the same data.  Since all names refer to the same data,
     changing the contents of one file changes the contents of all aliases to
     that file.  Aliasing a file in the UNIX system amounts to the system
     creating a new directory entry that contains the alias file name and
     then copying the i-number of a existing file to the i-number position of
     this new directory entry.  This action is accomplished by the link()
     system call.  The link() system call links an existing file to a new
     file.

     The prototype for link() is:

     int link(original_name, alias_name)
     char *original_name, *alias_name;

     where both original_name and alias_name are character strings that name
     the existing and new files respectively.  link() will fail and no link
     will be created if any of the following conditions holds:

        a path name component is not a directory.
        a path name component does not exist.
        a path name component is off-limits.
        original_name does not exist.
        alias_name does exist.
        original_name is a directory and you are not the superuser.
        a link is attempted across file systems.
        the destination directory for alias_name is not writable.
        the destination directory is on a mounted read-only file system.

     Following is a short example:

     /*  link.c
     */

     #include <stdio.h>

     int main()
     {
        if ((link("foo.old", "foo.new")) == -1)
           {
           perror(" ");
           exit (1);         /* return a non-zero exit code on error */
           }
        exit(0);
     }


                                       -14-














                                     unlink()

     The opposite of the link() system call is the unlink() system call.
     unlink() removes a file by zeroing the i-number part of the file's
     directory entry, reducing the link count field in the file's inode by 1,
     and releasing the data blocks and the inode if the link count field
     becomes zero.  unlink() is the only system call for removing a file in
     the UNIX system.

     The prototype for unlink() is:

     int unlink(file_name)
     char *file_name;

     where file_name names the file to be unlinked.  unlink() fails if any of
     the following conditions holds:

        a path name component is not a directory.
        a path name component does not exist.
        a path name component is off-limits.
        file_name does not exist.
        file_name is a directory and you are not the superuser.
        the directory for the file named by file_name is not writable.
        the directory is contained in a file system mounted read-only.

     It is important to understand that a file's contents and its inode are
     not discarded until all processes close the unlinked file.

     Following is a short example:

     /*  unlink.c
     */

     #include <stdio.h>

     int main()
     {
        if ((unlink("foo.bar")) == -1)
           {
           perror(" ");
           exit (1);         /* return a non-zero exit code on error */
           }
        exit (0);
     }

                             Process Related System Calls

                                         exec

     The UNIX system provides several system calls to create and end program, to
     send and receive software interrupts, to allocate memory, and to do other
     useful jobs for a process.  Four system calls are provided for creating a
     process, ending a process, and waiting for a process to complete.  These
     system calls are fork(), the "exec" family, wait(), and exit().

     The UNIX system calls that transform a executable binary file into a process
     are the "exec" family of system calls.  The prototypes for these calls are:

     int execl(file_name, arg0 [, arg1, ..., argn], NULL)
     char *file_name, *arg0, *arg1, ..., *argn;

     int execv(file_name, argv)
     char *file_name, *argv[];

     int execle(file_name, arg0 [, arg1, ..., argn], NULL, envp)
     char *file_name, *arg0, *arg1, ..., *argn, *envp[];

     int execve(file_name, argv, envp)
     char *file_name, *argv[], *envp[];

     int execlp(file_name, arg0 [, arg1, ..., argn], NULL)
     char *file_name, *arg0, *arg1, ..., *argn;

     int execvp(file_name, argv)
     char *file_name, *argv[];

     where file_name names the executable binary file to be transformed into a
     process, arg0 through argn and argv define the arguments to be passed to the
     process, and envp defines the environment, also to be passed to the process.
     By convention, arg0 and argv[0] name the last path name component of the
     executable binary file named by file_name.  For execl(), execv(), execle(),
     and execve(), file_name must be the fully qualified path name of the
     executable binary file.  However for execlp() and execvp(), the PATH variable
     is used to find the executable binary file.  When the environment is not
     explicitly given as an argument to an exec system call, the environment of
     the current process is used.  Furthermore, the last array element of both
     argv and envp must be null to signify the end of the array.

     Unlike the other system calls and subroutines, a successful exec system call
     does not return.  Instead, control is given to the executable binary file
     named as the first argument.  When that file is made into a process, that
     process replaces the process that executed the exec system call -- a new
     process is not created.  If an exec call should fail, it will return a -1.

     Letters added to the end of exec indicate the type of arguments:

        l  argn is specified as a list of arguments.

        v  argv is specified as a vector (array of character pointers).

        e  environment is specified as an array of character pointers.

        p  user's PATH is searched for command, and command can be a shell program

     Following is a brief description of the six routines that make up the
     collective family of exec routines:

        execl    Takes the path name of an executable program (binary file) as its
                 first argument.  The rest of the arguments are a list of command
                 line arguments to the new program (argv[]).  The list is
                 terminated with a null pointer:

                 execl("/bin/cat", "cat", "f1", "f2", (char *) 0);
                 execl("a.out", "a.out", (char *) 0);

                 Note that, by convention, the argument listed after the program
                 is the name of the command being executed (argv[0]).

        execle   Same as execl(), except that the end of the argument list is
                 followed by a pointer to a null-terminated list of character
                 pointers that is passed a the environment of the new program
                 (i.e., the place that getenv() searches for exported shell
                 variables):

                 static char *env[] = {
                    "TERM=vt100",
                    "PATH=/bin:/usr/bin",
                    (char *) 0 };

                 execle("/bin/cat", "cat", "f1", "f2", (char *) 0, env);

        execv    Takes the path name of an executable program (binary file) as it
                 first argument.  The second argument is a pointer to a list of
                 character pointers (like argv[]) that is passed as command line
                 arguments to the new program:

                 static char *args[] = {
                    "cat",
                    "f1",
                    "f2",
                    (char *) 0 };

                 execv("/bin/cat", args);


                                       -17-














        execve   Same as execv(), except that a third argument is given as a
                 pointer to a list of character pointers (like argv[]) that is
                 passed as the environment of the new program:

                 static char *env[] = {
                    "TERM=vt100",
                    "PATH=/bin:/usr/bin",
                    (char *) 0 };

                 static char *args[] = {
                    "cat",
                    "f1",
                    "f2",
                    (char *) 0 };

                 execve("/bin/cat", args, env);

        execlp   Same as execl(), except that the program name doesn't have to be
                 a full path name, and it can be a shell program instead of an
                 executable module:

                 execlp("ls", "ls", "-l", "/usr", (char *) 0);

                 execlp() searches the PATH environment variable to find the
                 specified program.

        execvp   Same as execv(), except that the program name doesn't have to be
                 a full path name, and it can be a shell program instead of an
                 executable module:

                 static char *args[] = {
                    "cat",
                    "f1",
                    "f2",
                    (char *) 0 };

                 execvp("cat", args);


     When transforming an executable binary file into a process, the UNIX system
     preserves some characteristics of the replaced process.  Among the items
     saved by the exec system call are:

        The "nice" value for scheduling.
        The process ID and the parent process ID.
        The time left until an alarm clock signal.
        The current working directory and the root directory.
        The file creation mask as established with umask().
        All open files.

     The last of these is the most interesting because the shell uses this feature
     to handle input/output redirection.

                                        fork()

     The exec family of system calls transforms an executable binary file into a
     process that overlays the process that made the exec system call.  The UNIX
     system does not create a new process in response to an exec system call.  To
     create a new process, you must use the fork() system call.  The prototype for
     the fork() system call is:

     int fork()

     fork() causes the UNIX system to create a new process, called the "child
     process", with a new process ID.  The contents of the child process are
     identical to the contents of the parent process.

     The new process inherits several characteristics of the old process.  Among
     the characteristics inherited are:

        The environment.
        All signal settings.
        The set user ID and set group ID status.
        The time left until an alarm clock signal.
        The current working directory and the root directory.
        The file creation mask as established with umask().

     The child process begins executing and the parent process continues executing
     at the return from the fork() system call.  This is difficult to understand
     at first because you only call fork() once, yet it returns twice -- once per
     process.  To differentiate which process is which, fork() returns zero in the
     child process and non-zero (the child's process ID) in the parent process.

     exec routines are usually called after a call to fork().  This combination,
     known as a fork/exec, allows a process to create a child to execute a
     command, so that the parent doesn't destroy itself through an exec.  Most
     command interpreters (e.g. the shell) on UNIX use fork and exec.

                                        wait()

     You can control the execution of child processes by calling wait() in the
     parent.  wait() forces the parent to suspend execution until the child is
     finished.  wait() returns the process ID of a child process that finished.
     If the child finishes before the parent gets around to calling wait(), then
     when wait() is called by the parent, it will return immediately with the
     child's process ID.  (It is possible to have more that one child process by
     simply calling fork() more than once.).  The prototype for the wait() system
     call is:

     int wait(status)
     int *status;

     where status is a pointer to an integer where the UNIX system stores the
     value returned by the child process.  wait() returns the process ID of the
     process that ended.  wait() fails if any of the following conditions hold:

        The process has no children to wait for.
        status points to an invalid address.


                                       -19-








     The format of the information returned by wait() is as follows:

        If the process ended by calling the exit() system call, the second lowest
        byte of status is set to the argument given to exit() and the lowest byte
        of status is set to zeroes.

        If the process ended because of a signal, the second lowest byte of status
        is set to zeroes and the lowest byte of status contains the signal number
        that ended the process.  If the seventh bit of the lowest byte of status
        is set (i.e.  status & 0200 == 0200) then the UNIX system produced a core
        dump of the process.

                                        exit()

     The exit() system call ends a process and returns a value to it parent.  The
     prototype for the exit() system call is:

     void exit(status)
     int status;

     where status is an integer between 0 and 255.  This number is returned to the
     parent via wait() as the exit status of the process.  By convention, when a
     process exits with a status of zero that means it didn't encounter any
     problems; when a process exit with a non-zero status that means it did have
     problems.

     exit() is actually not a system routine; it is a library routine that call
     the system routine _exit().  exit() cleans up the standard I/O streams before
     calling _exit(), so any output that has been buffered but not yet actually
     written out is flushed.  Calling _exit() instead of exit() will bypass this
     cleanup procedure.  exit() does not return.

     Following are some example programs that demonstrate the use of fork(),
     exec(), wait(), and exit():

     /* status.c
        demonstrates exit() returning a status to wait().
     */

     int main()
     {
        unsigned int status;

        if ( fork () == 0 )  {       /*  == 0 means in child  */
           scanf ("%d", &status);
           exit (status);
        }
        else  {                      /* != 0 means in parent */
           wait (&status);
           printf("child exit status = %d\n", status > 8);
        }
     }

     Note:  since wait() returns the exit status multiplied by 256 (contained in
     the upper 8 bits), the status value is shifted right 8 bits (divided by 256)
     to obtain the correct value.

                                  Software Interrupts

                                       signal()

     The UNIX system provides a facility for sending and receiving software
     interrupts, also called SIGNALS.  Signals are sent to a process when a
     predefined condition happens.  The number of signals available is system
     dependent.  For example, the University's HP-9000 has 31 signals defined.
     The signal name is defined in /usr/include/sys/signal.h as a manifest
     constant.

     Programs can respond to signals three different ways.  These are:

     1.  Ignore the signal.  This means that the program will never be informed of
     the signal no matter how many times it occurs.   The only exception to this
     is the SIGKILL signal which can neither be ignored nor caught.

     2.  A signal can be set to its default state, which means that the process
     will be ended when it receives that signal.  In addition, if the process
     receives any of SIGQUIT, SIGILL, SIGIOT, SIGEMT, SIGFPE, SIGBUS, SIGSEGV, or
     SIGSYS, the UNIX system will produce a core image (core dump), if possible,
     in the directory where the process was executing when it received the
     program-ending signal.

     3.  Catch the signal.  When the signal occurs, the UNIX system will transfer
     control to a previously defined subroutine where it can respond to the signal
     as is appropriate for the program.

     You define how you want to respond to a signal with the signal() system call.
     The prototype is:

     #include <sys/signal.h>

     int (* signal ( signal_name, function ))
     int signal_name;
     int (* function)();

     where signal_name is the name of the signal from signal.h and function is any
     of SIG_IGN, meaning that you wish to ignore the signal when it occurs;
     SIG_DFL, meaning that you wish the UNIX system to take the default action
     when your program receives the signal; or a pointer to a function that
     returns an integer.  The function is given control when your program receives
     the signal, and the signal number is passed as an argument.  signal() returns
     the previous value of function, and signal() fails if any of the following
     conditions hold:

        signal_name is an illegal name or SIGKILL.

        function points to an invalid memory address.



                                       -23-













     Once a signal is caught, the UNIX system resets it to its initial state (the
     default condition).  In general, if you intend for your program to be able to
     catch a signal repeatedly, you need to re-arm the signal handling mechanism.
     You must do this as soon after receipt of the signal as possible, namely just
     after entering the signal handling routine.

     You should use signals in your programs to isolate critical sections from
     interruption.

     The state of all signals is preserved across a fork() system call, but all
     caught signals are set to SIG_DFL across an exec system call.


                                        kill()

     The UNIX system sends a signal to a process when something happens, such as
     typing the interrupt key on a terminal, or attempting to execute an illegal
     instruction.  Signals are also sent to a process with the kill() system call.
     Its prototype is:

     int kill (process_id, signal_name )
     int process_it, signal_name;

     where process_id is the ID of the process to be signaled and signal_name is
     the signal to be sent to that process.  If process_id has a positive value,
     that value is assumed to be the process ID of the process to whom signal_name
     signal is to be sent.  If process_id has the value 0, then signal_name signal
     is sent to all processes in the sending process' process group, that is all
     processes that have been started from the same terminal.  If process_id has
     the value -1 and the process executing the kill() system call is the
     superuser, then signal_name is sent to all processes excluding process 0 and
     process 1 that have the same user ID as the process executing the kill().
     kill() fails if any of the following conditions hold:

        signal_name is not a valid signal.

        there is not a process in the system with process ID process_id.

        even though the process named by process_id is in the system, you cannot
        send it a signal because your effective user ID does not match either the
        real or effective user ID of process_id.

                                        alarm()

     Every process has an alarm clock stored in its system-data segment.  When the
     alarm goes off, signal SIGALRM is sent to the calling process.  A child
     inherits its parent's alarm clock value, but the actual clock isn't shared.
     The alarm clock remains set across an exec.

     The prototype for alarm() is:

     unsigned int alarm(seconds)
     unsigned int seconds;

     where seconds defines the time after which the UNIX system sends the SIGALRM
     signal to the calling process.  Each successive call to alarm() nullifies the
     previous call, and alarm() returns the number of seconds until that alarm
     would have gone off.  If seconds has the value 0, the alarm is canceled.
     alarm() has no error conditions.

     The following is an example program that demonstrates the use of the signal()
     and alarm() system calls:

     /*  timesup.c  */

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <sys/signal.h>

     #define  EVER  ;;

     void main();
     int times_up();

     void main()
     {
        signal (SIGALRM, times_up);         /* go to the times_up function  */
                                            /* when the alarm goes off.     */
        alarm (10);                         /* set the alarm for 10 seconds */

        for (EVER)                          /* endless loop.                */
           ;                                /* hope the alarm works.        */
     }

     int times_up(sig)
     int sig;                               /* value of signal              */
     {
        printf("Caught signal #< %d >n", sig);
        printf("Time's up!  I'm outta here!!\n");
        exit(sig);                          /* return the signal number     */

                              Interprocess Communication

     UNIX System V allows processes to communicate with one another using pipes,
     messages, semaphores, and shared memory.  This sections describes how to
     communicate using pipes.

     One way to communicate between two processes is to create a pipeline with the
     pipe() system call.  pipe() builds the channel, but it is up to you to
     connect the standard input of one process to the standard output of the other
     process.

     The prototype for pipe() is:

     int pipe (file_descriptors)
     int file_descriptors[2];

     where file_descriptors[2] is an array that pipe() fills with a file
     descriptor opened for reading, file_descriptor[0], and a file_descriptor
     opened for writing, file_descriptor[1].  pipe() fails for the following
     condition:

        there are too many open I/O channels.

     Some I/O system calls act differently on pipe file descriptors from the way
     they do on ordinary files, and some do nothing at all.  Following is a
     summary of these actions:

        write    Data written to a pipe is sequenced in order of arrival.
                 Normally, is the pipe becomes full, write() will block until
                 enough old data is removed by read().  There are no partial
                 writes; the entire write() will be completed.  The capacity of a
                 pipe varies  with the UNIX implementation, but it is always at
                 least 4096 bytes (4K).  If fcntl() is called to set the O_NDELAY
                 flag, write() will not block on a full pipe and will return a
                 count of 0.  The only way to put an end-of-file on a pipe is to
                 close the writing file descriptor.

        read     Data is read from a pipe in order of arrival, just as it was
                 written.  Once read, data can't be reread or put back.  Normally,
                 if the pipe is empty, read will block until at least one byte of
                 data is available, unless the writing file descriptor is closed,
                 in which case the read will return a 0 count (the usual
                 end-of-file indication).  But the byte count given as the third
                 argument to read will not necessarily be satisfied - only as many
                 bytes as are present at that instant will be read, and an
                 appropriate count will be returned.  The byte count will never be
                 exceeded, of course; unread bytes will remain for the next
                 read().  If the O_NDELAY flag is set, a read() on an empty pipe
                 will return with a 0 count.  This suffers from the same ambiguity
                 as reads on communication lines.  A 0 count also means
                 end-of-file.


                                       -26-












        close    Means more on a pipe than it does on a file.  Not only does it
                 free up the file descriptor for reuse, but when the writing file
                 descriptor is closed it acts as an end-of-file for the reader.
                 If the read end file descriptor is closed, a write() on the other
                 file descriptor will cause and error.  A fatal signal is also
                 normally generated (SIGPIPE - #13).

        fcntl    This system call sets or clears the O_NDELAY flag, whose effect
                 is described under write and read above.

        fstat    Not very useful on pipes.  The size returned is the number of
                 bytes in the pipe, but this fact is seldom useful.  A pipe may be
                 distinguished by a link count of 0, since a pipe is the only
                 source of a file descriptor associated with something not linked
                 into a directory.  This distinction might be useful to I/O
                 routines that want to treat pipes specially.

        open     Not used with pipes.

        creat    Not used with pipes.

        lseek    Not used with pipes.  This means that if a pipe contains a
                 sequence of messages, it isn't possible to look through them for
                 the message to read next.  Like toothpaste in a tube, you have to
                 get it out to examine it, and then there is no way to put it
                 back.


     Pipes use the buffer cache just as ordinary files do.  Therefore, the
     benefits of writing and reading pipes in units of a block (usually 512 or
     1024 bytes) are just as great.  A single write() execution is atomic, so if
     512 bytes are written with a single system call, the corresponding read()
     will return with 512 bytes (if it requests that many).  It will not return
     with less than the full block.  However, if the writer is not writing
     complete blocks, but the reader is trying to read complete blocks, the reader
     may keep getting partial blocks anyway.

     The following example program demonstrates how to set up a one-way pipe
     between two related processes.  Note that the processes MUST be related
     (parent, child, grandchild, etc.) since the pipe mechanism is based on the
     fact that file descriptors are inherited when a process is created.  Error
     checking in the following program has been minimized in order to keep the
     code uncluttered and readable.  In a "real" program more error checking on
     the system calls should be done.

                                      File Status

                                   stat() - fstat()

     The i-node data structure holds all the information about a file except the
     file's name and its contents.  Sometimes your programs need to use the
     information in the i-node structure to do some job.  You can access this
     information with the stat() and fstat() system calls.  stat() and fstat()
     return the information in the i-node for the file named by a string and by a
     file descriptor, respectively.  The format for the i-node struct returned by
     these system calls is defined in /usr/include/sys/stat.h.  stat.h uses types
     built with the C language typedef construct and defined in the file
     /usr/include/sys/types.h, so it too must be included and must be included
     before the inclusion of the stat.h file.

     The prototypes for stat() and fstat() are:

     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/stat.h>

     int stat(file_name, stat_buf)
     char *file_name;
     struct stat *stat_buf;

     int fstat(file_descriptor, stat_buf)
     int file_descriptor;
     struct stat *stat_buf;

     where file_name names the file as an ASCII string and file_descriptor names
     the I/O channel and therefore the file.  Both calls returns the file's
     specifics in stat_buf.  stat() and fstat() fail if any of the following
     conditions hold:

        a path name component is not a directory (stat() only).

        file_name does not exit (stat() only).

        a path name component is off-limits (stat() only).

        file_descriptor does not identify an open I/O channel (fstat() only).

        stat_buf points to an invalid address.

     Following is an extract of the stat.h file from the University's HP-9000.  It
     shows the definition of the stat structure and some manifest constants used
     to access the st_mode field of the structure.

                                       access()

     To determine if a file is accessible to a program, the access() system call
     may be used.  Unlike any other system call that deals with permissions,
     access() checks the real user-ID or group-ID, not the effective ones.

     The prototype for the access() system call is:

     int access(file_name, access_mode)
     char *file_name;
     int access_mode;

     where file_name is the name of the file to which access permissions given in
     access_mode are to be applied.  Access modes are often defined as manifest
     constants in /usr/include/sys/file.h.  The available modes are:

        Value    Meaning        file.h constant
        -----    ------         ------
        00       existence      F_OK
        01       execute        X_OK
        02       write          W_OK
        04       read           R_OK

     These values may be ORed together to check for mone than one access
     permission.  The call to access() returns 0 if the program has the given
     access permissions, otherwise -1 is returned and errno is set to the reason
     for failure.  This call is somewhat useful in that it makes checking for a
     specific permission easy.  However, it only answers the question "do I have
     this permission?"  It cannot answer the question "what permissions do I
     have?"

     The following example program demonstrates the use of the access() system
     call to remove a file.  Before removing the file, a check is made to make
     sure that the file exits and that it is writable (it will not remove a
     read-only file).

                         Miscellaneous System Calls / Examples

                                      Directories

     A directory is simply a special file that contains (among other information)
     i-number/filename pairs.  With the exception of 4.2 and 4.3 BSD, all versions
     of the UNIX system limit filenames to 14 characters.  These short filenames
     make for a simple fixed size directory format on System V.

                                 System V Directories

     A directory contains structures of type direct, defined in the include file
     /usr/include/sys/dir.h.  The include file /usr/include/sys/types.h must also
     be included to define the types used by the structure.  The directory
     structure is:

     #define DIRSIZ   14

     struct direct  {
           ino_t    d_ino;
           char     d_name[DIRSIZ];
     };

     It should be noted that the name of the file, d_name is NOT guaranteed to be
     null-terminated; programs should always be careful of this.  Files which have
     been deleted will have i-numbers (d_ino) equal to zero; these should in
     general be skipped over when reading the directory.  A directory is read
     simply by opening it (in read-only mode) and reading structures either one at
     a time or all at once.  The following example program simply opens the
     current directory and prints the names of all the files it contains.  The
     program simulates the ls -a command.  Note that the file names are not sorted
     like the real ls command would do.

     /*  my_ls.c
         This program simulates the System V style ls -a command.  Filenames
         are printed as they occur in the directory -- no sorting is done.
     */

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <fcntl.h>
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/dir.h>

     #define  ERR  (-1)

     int main()
     {
        int fd;
        struct direct dir;

        if (( fd = open (".", O_RDONLY)) == ERR)      /* open current directory */
           {
           perror("open");
           exit (1);
           }


                                       -35-








        while (( read (fd, &dir, sizeof (struct direct)) > 0 )
           {
           if ( dir.d_ino == 0 )               /* is it a deleted file?  */
              continue;                        /* yes, so go read another */

           /* make sure we print no more than DIRSIZ characters  */

           printf ("%.*s\n", DIRSIZ, dir.d_name);
           }
        close (fd);
        exit (0);
     }


     If you need more information about the file such as size or permissions, you
     would use the stat() system call to obtain it.

                              Berkeley Style Directories

     A directory contains structures of type direct, defined in the include file
     /usr/include/sys/ndir.h.  The include file /usr/include/sys/types.h must also
     be included to define the types used by the structure.  The directory
     structure is:

     #define MAXNAMLEN 255
     #define DIRSIZ_CONSTANT 14      /* equivalent to DIRSIZ */

     struct  direct {
        long    d_fileno;               /* file number of entry */
        short   d_reclen;               /* length of this record */
        short   d_namlen;               /* length of string in d_name */
        char    d_name[MAXNAMLEN + 1];  /* name (up to MAXNAMLEN + 1) */
     };

     #if !(defined KERNEL) && !(defined ATT3B2)
     #define d_ino   d_fileno                /* compatibility */

     Unlike on System V, filenames can be longer than 14 characters and the size
     of a directory structure can be variable.  Therefore, the read() call can not
     be used to read the directory.  Instead, Berkely style systems provide a set
     of library functions to read directories.  These functions are also declared
     in the ndir.h include file.  They are:

     extern  DIR *opendir();
     extern  struct direct *readdir();
     extern  long telldir();
     extern  void seekdir();
     #define rewinddir(dirp) seekdir((dirp), (long)0)
     extern  void closedir();



                                       -36-













     The following example shows how to perform a Berkeley (or HP) style  ls -a
     read of a directory.  One important note:  filenames in the directory
     structure are null-terminated in Berkeley style systems -- on System V they
     are not.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <ndir.h>

     main()
     {

        DIR *dirp;
        struct direct *dp;

        dirp = opendir(".");                   /* open the current directory */
        while ((dp = readdir(dirp)) != NULL)
        {
        if (dp->d_ino == 0)               /* ignore deleted files    */
           continue;
        else
           printf("%s\n",dp->d_name);       /* the name is null-terminated */
        }
     }

                                         Time


     The UNIX operating system keeps track of the current date and time by storing
     the number of seconds that have elasped since midnight January 1, 1970 UTC
     (Coordinated Universal Time, also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)).  This
     date is considered the informal "birthday" of the UNIX operating system.  The
     time is stored in a signed long integer.  (For the curious, assuming a 32 bit
     signed long integer, UNIX time will break at 03:14:08 January 19, 2038 UTC.)

     In all versions of UNIX, the time() system call may be used to obtain the
     time of day.  This call is peculiar in that if given the address of a long
     integer as an argument, it places the time in that integer and returns it.
     If, however, a null pointer is passed, the time of day is just returned.

     Several routines are available to convert the long integer returned by time()
     into an ASCII date string.  With the UNIX operating system, an ASCII date
     string is a string as shown below:

           Day Mon dd hh:mm:ss yyyy

     For example:  Sat Mar 24 11:03:36 1990

     The ctime() library function can be used to do the above conversion.  An
     example is:

     /*  my_date.c
         print the current date and time in a format similar to the output
         of the date command.
     */

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <time.h>      /* may need to be  #include <sys/time.h> instead */

     int main()
     {
        long now, time();
        char *ctime();

        time (&now);
        printf("It is now %s\n", ctime (&now));

        exit (0);
     }







                                       -38-














     Often you need access to specific information about the current date and
     time.  The localtime() and gmtime() functions will provide it.  They do this
     by converting the long integer returned by time() into a data structure
     called tm, which is defined in the time.h header file.  In fact, this is what
     the header file looks like:

     struct tm {
        int   tm_sec;     /* seconds after the minute - [0,59] */
        int   tm_min;     /* minutes after the hour - [0,59] */
        int   tm_hour;    /* hours since midnight - [0,23] */
        int   tm_mday;    /* day of the month - [1,31] */
        int   tm_mon;     /* months since January - [0,11] */
        int   tm_year;    /* years since 1900 */
        int   tm_wday;    /* days since Sunday - [0,6] */
        int   tm_yday;    /* days since January 1 - [0,365] */
        int   tm_isdst;   /* daylight savings time flag */
        };

     As you can see, there is quite a bit of information you can access.  The
     tm_isdst member is non-zero if Daylight Savings Time is in effect.  The
     localtime() function returns the time in the local time zone, whereas the
     gmtime() function returns the time in the UTC (or GMT) time zone.  Both
     localtime() and gmtime() take as their argument a pointer to a long integer
     that represents the date and time as the number of seconds since January 1,
     1970 (such a returned by time() ).  The return pointers to a tm structure,
     where the converted data is placed.  The following example prints the local
     date in the familiar mm/dd/yy format:

     /*  day.c
         print date in  mm/dd/yy format
     */

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <time.h>        /* may need to be #include <sys/time.h> instead */

     int main()
     {
        long now, time();
        struct tm *today, *localtime();

        time (&now);
        today = localtime (&now);

        printf("Today is:  %d/%d/%d\n", today->tm_mon + 1, today->tm_mday,
                                        today->tm_year);
        exit (0);
     }

                                     Parsing Input


     When dealing with input from a command line, the first step is to parse
     (break up) the input line into tokens, which are groups of characters that
     form syntactic units; examples are words, strings, and special symbols.
     Following are some sample programs and functions that demonstrate various
     ways to parse an input line:

     /*  parse.c
              Split the input buffer into individual tokens.  Tokens are
              assumed to be separated by space or tab characters.
              A pointer to each token is stored in an array of pointers.
              This method is very similar to the argv argument to main().
     */
     #include <stdio.h>
     #define  EVER  ;;
     #define  MAXARG  64

     int main()
     {
        char buf[256];
        char *args[MAXARG];         /* accept MAXARG number of tokens */
        int num_arg,
                lcv;

        for (EVER)
           {
           printf("Enter line: ");
           if ((gets(buf)) == (char *) NULL)
              {
              putchar('\n');
              exit(0);
              }
           num_arg = parse_cmd(buf, args);
           printf("Number of tokens = %d\n",num_arg);
           for (lcv = 0; lcv < num_arg; lcv++)
                 puts(args[lcv]);
           }
     }











                                       -40-














     int parse_cmd(buf, args)
     char *buf;
     char **args;
     {
        int count = 0;

        while (*buf != '\0' && count < MAXARG)
           {
           while ((*buf == ' ') || (*buf == '\t'))
                 *buf++ = '\0';
           *args++ = buf;
           ++count;
           while ((*buf != '\0') && (*buf != ' ') && (*buf != '\t'))
                 buf++;
           }
        *args = (char *) NULL;   /* make the last element of the array null */
        return(count);         /* return the number of tokens parsed  */
     }


     There is a C library function available that makes parsing a string into
     tokens very easy; it is strtok().  Following is the above function (parse_cmd
     () ) as implemented using strtok():

     int parse_cmd(line, args)
     char *line;
     char *args[];
     {
        int count = 0;
        char *str, *strtok();
        static char delimiters[] = " \t\n";

        while (( str = strtok(line, delimiters)) != (char *) NULL)
           {
           line = (char *) NULL;
           args[count++] = str;
           }
        args[count] = (char *) NULL;
        return(count);
     }


     strtok() takes as arguments a pointer to the input string and a pointer to a
     string containing the character or characters that delimit the token.  In the
     above example, the delimiters were defined to be a space, tab, or newline.
     You are free to change the delimiter at any time.  If you wish strtok() to
     parse the complete line, you must pass a null-pointer on the second and
     subsequent calls to strtok()  (note that "line" was set to null inside the
     body of the while loop).  strtok() returns a null-pointer when the end of the
     input string is reached.

     strtok() is very useful in parsing the individual path elements as defined in
     the PATH environment variable (set the delimiter to ":" ).

                                        CURSES


     What is curses?  curses is a terminal-independent library of C routines and
     macros that you use to write "window-based" screen management programs on the
     UNIX system.  curses is designed to let programmers control terminal I/O in
     an easy fashion.  Providing an easy-to-use "human interface" for users is an
     increasingly important requirement for operating systems.  Such a connection
     between the machine and the humans that use it plays an important role in the
     overall productivity of the system.  curses gets its name from what it does:
     cursor manipulation.

     What can curses do?  Among the functions to be found in curses are those
     that:
           - Move the cursor to any point on the screen
           - Insert text anywhere on the screen, doing it even in highlight mode
           - Divide the screen into rectangular areas called windows
           - Manage each window independently, so you can be scrolling one window 
            while erasing a line in another
           - Draw a box around a window using a character of your choice
           - Write output to and read input from a terminal screen
           - Control the data output and input -- for example, to print output in 
            bold type or prevent it from echoing (printing back on a screen)
           - Draw simple graphics

     If these features leave you unimpressed, remember that they are only tools.
     When you use these tools in your programs, the results can be spectacular.
     The point is -- curses is easy to use and ready to go -- so that you can
     concentrate on what you want your program to do.  curses will make you
     program look sharp.

     Where did curses come from?  The author of curses in Ken Arnold who wrote the
     package while a student at the University of California, Berkeley.  At the
     same time, Bill Joy was writing his editor program, vi.  Ken Arnold credits
     Bill Joy with providing the ideas (as well as code) for creating the
     capability to generally describe terminals, writing routines to read the
     terminal database, and implementing routines for optimal cursor movement.
     The original source of information about curses is Ken Arnold's paper
     entitled "Screen Updating and Cursor Movement Optimization:  A Library
     Package".

     What makes curses tick?  The original version of curses developed by Ken
     Arnold incorporated a database known as termcap, or the terminal capabilities
     database.  In System V Release 2, the termcap database was replaced by the
     terminfo data base, and curses was rewritten to incorporate it.  Both of
     these versions of curses can be used with more than one hundred terminals.
     The information in the termcap or terminfo database is used by the curses
     routines to determine what sequence of special characters must be sent to a
     particular terminal to cause it to clear the screen, move the cursor up one
     line, delete a line, etc.  It is these databases that make curses truly
     terminal independent, since any terminal not already in the database can be
     added by a system administrator, and since the structure of both databases
     allows users to add their own local additions or modifications for a
     particular terminal.

     How to use curses -- the basics:  There are a couple of things you have to
     know before you can start using the curses library.  First, when you compile
     a C program that call curses routines, you must specify to the cc command
     that the curses library is to be linked in with the program.  This is done
     with the -lcurses option, which must be specified after all the C program
     files.  The following is an example cc command line for use on systems that
     support the terminfo database:

     cc myprog.c -lcurses

     Next is an example cc command line for use on systems that support the
     termcap database:

     cc myprog.c -lcurses -ltermlib

     Second, all program files that reference curses routines must include the
     header file <curses.h>  <curses.h> will include the header <stdio.h> so it
     is not necessary for your program to include it.  It won't hurt anything if
     you do -- it just slows down the compilation.  Lastly, before you run a
     program that uses curses, you must inform curses what type of terminal you
     have.  You do this by setting the shell variable TERM to the type of terminal
     you are using (e.g. a DEC VT100) and exporting the TERM variable into the
     environment.  This is done in the following manner:

     $ TERM=vt100
     $ export TERM

     This action is usually done for you by your .profile when you log it.

     The <curses.h> header file contains declarations for variables, constants,
     data structures and macros.  Among the variables are two integer variables
     that prove to be very useful:  LINES and COLS.  LINES is automatically set to
     the number of lines on your terminal; COLS is set to the number of columns.
     Many of the curses routines address the terminal's screen, in that they move
     the cursor to a specific place, or address.  This address is specified as a
     particular row and column (specified as arguments to the routine), where the
     address of the upper left-hand corner is row LINES-1 and column COLS-1
     (LINES-1, COLS-1).  Following is a layout of the terminal screen:


                    IMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM;
                    :(0,0)                              (0, COLS-1):
                    :                                              :
                    :                                              :
                R   :                                              :

     All programs using the curses library must have the following basic
     structure: 

     #include <curses.h>

     main()
     {
           initscr();

           /* main program */

           endwin();
     }

     The initscr() function must be called before any other curses routines.  Its
     function is to determine the terminal type from the TERM environment variable
     and to initialize certain data structures and variables (e.g. LINES and
     COLS).  The endwin() function should be called prior to program exit to
     restore the terminal's original state.  Some curses routines change the
     terminal's characteristics (e.g. go into raw mode and turn off echoing) and
     must be undone before the program exits; otherwise the terminal is left in an
     odd state and the user may not know how to change it back.  Here is how to
     fix the terminal if a curses program leaves it in a "funny" state:

     on System III and System V UNIX systems (including XENIX) type:

           stty sane ctrl-j

     note that you must type a control-j and not the return key, since most likely
     NEWLINE mapping will be off and the RETURN key will not work.

     on Berkeley UNIX systems type:

           stty -raw -cbreak -nl echo ek ctrl-j

     Windows and screens:  Conceptually, a window is an independent rectangular
     area of characters displayed on the screen.  Physically, a window is a
     WINDOW, that is, a C data structure that holds all the information about a
     window.

     The Standard Screen - stdscr:  The traditional definition of the "standard
     screen" is a window or a set of windows that fills the entire screen of a
     video display terminal.  The structure that describes stdscr is a WINDOW, or
     more precisely, a pointer to a WINDOW.  A WINDOW is a character array that
     maintains an image of the terminal screen, known as the screen image.  The
     screen image array in stdscr is automatically made the length and width of
     the terminal screen.  Thus, there is one character in that array for every
     place on the screen.



                                       -44-














     The Current Screen - curscr:  curses does not know directly what the terminal
     is displaying; it would be even slower to have to query the terminal to find
     out what character is being displayed at each location.  Instead, curses
     keeps and image of what it thinks the screen looks like in a window called
     curscr.  curscr, like stdscr, is created automatically when you initialize
     curses with initscr().  curscr is a WINDOW, and has a screen image the size
     of the physical screen.  When refresh() is called, it writes the characters
     that it is sending to the terminal into their corresponding location in the
     screen image of curscr.  curscr contains the image of the screen as curses
     thinks it was made to look by the last refresh().  refresh() uses the screen
     image in curscr to minimize its work.  When it goes to refresh a window, it
     compares the contents of that window to curscr.  refresh() assumes that the
     physical screen looks like curscr so it does not output characters that are
     the same in curscr and the window that is being refreshed.  In this way,
     refresh() minimizes the number of characters that it sends to the screen and
     save a great deal of time.


     The following are a few of the more commonly used curses routines.  The list
     is not comprehensive:

     Terminal Modes:  the terminal modes for I/O are usually set after the call to
     initscr().  None of the mode setting routines accept parameters.

        echo() / noecho()       These functions allow programmers to turn on or
                                off the terminal driver's echoing to the terminal.
                                The default state is echo on.  The function
                                noecho() disables the automatic echoing.
        nl() / nonl()           These functions allow programmers to enable or
                                disable carriage return/newline mappings.  When
                                enabled, carriage return is mapped on input to
                                newline and newline is mapped on output to
                                newline/carriage return.  The default state is
                                mapping enabled., and nonl() is used to turn this
                                mapping off.  It is interesting to note that while
                                mapping is disabled, cursor movement is optimized.
        cbreak() / nocbreak()   Canonical processing (line at a time character
                                processing) is disabled within the terminal driver
                                when calling cbreak(), allowing a break for each
                                character.  Interrupt and flow control keys are
                                unaffected.  The default state is nocbreak, which
                                enables canonical processing.
        raw() / noraw()         These functions are similar to the cbreak() /
                                nocbreak() functions, except that interrupt and
                                flow control key are also disabled or enabled.
        savetty() / resetty()   The current state of the terminal can be saved
                                into a buffer reserved by curses when calling
                                savetty() function.  The last save state can be
                                restored via the resetty() function.
        gettmode()              This function is used to establish the current tty
                                mode while in curses.  It reads the baud rate of
                                the terminal, turns off the mapping of carriage
                                returns to line feeds on output, and the expansion
                                of tabs into spaces by the system.

                       identically to the insch() function.

        deleteln()     This function allows the deletion of the current cursor
                       line, moving all lines located below up one line and
                       filling the last line with blank spaces.  The cursor
                       position remains unchanged.

        insertln()     This function inserts a blank filled line at the current
                       cursor line, moving all lines located below down one line.
                       The bottom line is lost, and the current cursor position is
                       unaffected.

        refresh()      This function is used to update the physical terminal
                       screen from the window buffer and all changes made to that
                       buffer (via curses functions) will be written.  If the
                       buffer size is smaller than the physical screen, then only
                       that part of the screen is refreshed, leaving everything
                       else unchanged.

        wrefresh()     This function is identical to the refresh() function,
                       except that the refresh operation is performed on the named
                       window.
           #include <curses.h>
           main()

        initscr()      This function call must be present in all programs calling
                       the curses functions.  It clears the physical terminal
                       screen and sets up the default modes.  It should be the
                       first call to the curses functions when using the library
                       to initialize the terminal.

        endwin()       This function call should be present in any program using
                       the curses functions, and should also be the last function
                       call of that program.  It restores all terminal settings to
                       their original state prior to using the initscr() function
                       call and it places the cursor to the lower left hand
                       portion of the screen and terminates a curses program.

        attrset()      This function allows the programmer to set single or
                       multiple terminal attributes.  The call attrset(0) resets
                       all attributes to their default state.

        attron()       This function is used to set the named attribute of a
                       terminal to an on state.
           #include <curses.h>
           main()

        attroff()      This function is the opposite of the attron() function and
                       will turn off the named attribute of a terminal.

        standout()     This function sets the attribute A_STANDOUT to an on state,
                       and is nothing more than a convenient way of saying
                       attron(A_STANDOUT).
           #include <curses.h>
           main()

        standend()     This function, like standout(), is just a convenient way of
                       saying attroff(A_STANDOUT), meaning that the A_STANDOUT
                       attribute is set to an off state.  Actually, this function
                       resets all attributes to the off state.

        box()          This function draws a box around the edge of the window.
                       One of its arguments is the horizontal character and the
                       other is the vertical character.
           #include <curses.h>
           main()
           {
              initscr();
              box(stdscr, '-', '*');
              /* draws a box around the stdscr  */
              /* horizontal characters are '-' and vertical characters are '*' */
              refresh();

     Attribute Values:  the following is a list of the terminal attributes that
     may be set on or off using the curses library.  It is important to note that
     all of these attributes may not be available to the physical terminal,
     depending upon the given terminal's characteristics.

        A_STANDOUT - this attribute allows the terminal to display characters in
        highlight, bold, or some other fashion (depending upon the terminal's
        characteristics).

        A_REVERSE - this attribute allows the terminal to display its characters
        in reverse video.

        A_BOLD - this attribute allows the terminal to display its characters in
        bold lettering.

        A_DIM - this attribute allows the terminal to display its characters at
        less intensity than normal.

        A_UNDERLINE - this attribute allows the terminal to display characters
        with a horizontal line beneath them (underlined).

        A_BLINE - this attribute allows the terminal to display blinking
        characters that will appear and disappear at a rate depending upon the
        terminal characteristics.

     Creating and Removing Windows:  

        WINDOW *newwin(lines, cols, y1, x1) will create a new window.  The new
        window will have lines lines and cols columns, with the upper left corner
        located at (y1,x1).  newwin() returns a pointer to WINDOW that points at
        the new window structure.  The screen image in the new window is filled
        with blanks.

        WINDOW *subwin(win, lines, cols, y1, x1) will create a sub-window. win is
        a pointer to the parent window.  The other arguments are the same as in
        newwin(), except lines and cols are interpreted relative to the parent's
        window and not the terminal screen.  A sub-window is a real WINDOW and may
        have sub-windows just as easily as the parent window.

        delwin(win) will delete the specified window.  delwin() calls the system
        utility free() to return the space to the pool of available memory.  If
        the window is a sub-window, delwin() does not free() the space because
        that space is still being used by the parent.  Deletint a parent does not
        free the space occupied by sub-windows.  The sub-windows will continue to
        occupy space, but their screen images will be undefined.  You should take
        care to delete windows in the proper order and when needed in order to
        maintain good housekeeping of the available memory.

     Window Specific Functions:  these functions are some of the functions above
     applied to a window.  A 'w' is placed before the function name, and the first
     argument is a pointer to the window.

        waddch(win, ch)         winch(win)
        waddstr(win,str)        winsch(win, c)

        wgetch(win)             wstandend(win)
        wgetstr(win,str)

     Move and Act Function:  these functions first move the cursor, then perform
     their action.  The function names have a 'mv' placed before the corresponding
     function above.

        mvaddch(y,x,ch)         mvwaddch(win,y,x,ch)
        mvaddstr(y,x,str)       mvwaddstr(win,y,x,ch)

                                          AWK

                                     What is awk?

     awk is one of the more unusual UNIX commands.  Named after and by its
     creators:  Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan, awk combines pattern matching,
     comparison making, line decomposition, numberical operations, and C-like
     programming features into one program.

     awk is a "small" language, in that it lacks some of the more complicated
     features found in traditional languages like C, Pascal, and Ada.  In general,
     awk omits many mechanisms that support the development of large applications,
     such as modules and user defined types.

     Nonetheless, awk is a powerful and general-purpose language, capable of
     nearly anything you would want a programming language to do.  The language
     omissions foster the development of small applications, as do the robust
     string manipulation capabilities and the powerful table facility.  awk's
     automatic storage management frees the programmer from having to explicitly
     keep track of memory -- this alone can cut programming and debugging in half.

                            The Structure of an awk Program

     Many applications consist of simple collections of patterns and actions.
     Each time a pattern is recognized in the input, the corresponding action is
     executed.  C code to do this would resemble the following:

     while ( getRecord() != EOF) {
        if ( pattern1)  { action1 }
        if ( pattern2)  { action2 }
        ...
        if ( patternN)  { actionN }
     }
     Because this approach is suitable to so many applications, awk's syntax was
     specifically streamlined to support it.  The corresponding awk program
     eliminates the outermost control-flow syntax:

     pattern1  { action1 }
     pattern2  { action2 }
     ...
     patternN  { actionN }

     awk read each line in the input file(s) one at a time.  When a line is read,
     each pattern is tested in sequence.  Whenever a pattern matches the current
     line, the corresponding action is executed.  This continues until all the
     input has been processed.

     awk breaks each input record into fields separated  by whitespace (or a
     specified delimiter).  Within the awk program, fields are designated $1, $2,
     etc., and the variable NF is set to the total number of fields in the current
     record.  The variable $0 stands for the entire record not broken into fields.



                                       -57-











     Patterns resemble boolean expressions, with the addition of regular
     expression operators, ~, and a syntax for regular expressions contained in
     slashes added e.g. the pattern $2 ~ /foo/ is true if the field $2 contains a
     substring  "foo".  A regular expression without an explicit range is matched
     against the input record ($0).

     Several patterns are special.  Action connected to BEGIN is executed once
     before any records are read.  END action is executed once after all input
     records are processed.  Omitted patterns match every record.

                         Example Application - Create an Index

     An index might be appended to the end of a report, or it might be used to
     extract specific cross-reference information from source code.  An awk script
     to generate an index is characteristically simple:

     BEGIN {  while (getline < "keywords" > 0)
                 KEY[$0] = ""
           }
           {  for (k in KEY)
                 if( $0 ~ k)
                    KEY[k] = KEY[k] " " NR
           }
     END   { for ( k in KEY)
                 print k, KEY[k]
           }

     The action associated with BEGIN reads a list of keywords to be indexed from
     a file called keywords.  Each keyword is used as an index into a table called
     KEY, and the corresponding entries in the table are nulled.

     The middle action (with no pattern) executes for every input file line.  Each
     line is checked for the presence of each keyword in the KEY table.  The line
     number (NR) is appended to the KEY entry for each match.

     After all lines are processed, the END action prints each keyword followed by
     the lines where it appeared.

                                   Rapid Prototyping

     awk is suitable for prototyping applications -- quickly implementing ideas to
     test feasibility before making a major investment in implementation.  If the
     idea is a bad one, this can be discovered after 50 lines of awk rather than
     5000 lines of C.  Rapid prototyping provides prospective users with a program
     to "play with" -- the most effective way to find out what the users really
     want in the final product.  Typical awk prototypes are often less that 10% of
     the length of the equivalent C program.  Once you have a suitable prototype
     program written in awk, you can decide whether to recode the program in a
